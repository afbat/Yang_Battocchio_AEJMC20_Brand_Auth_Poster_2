"Effects of Transparent Brand Communication on Perceived Brand Authenticity and Consumer Responses" by Jing Yang, Ph.D. and Ava Francesca Battocchio, M.S. 
To be presented at AEJMC's Advertising Divisions' Scholar-to-Scholar Refereed Paper Session on August 7th, 2020. 

This poster (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343084154_Effects_of_Transparent_Brand_Communication_on_Perceived_Brand_Authenticity_and_Consumer_Responses) was adapted from a previous template made by Gerlinde Kettl and Matthias Weiser (tex@kettl.de)

Alterations include addition of the following categories: abstract, literature review, discussion and references.

References were included using BibLaTeX and a .bib file exported from a Zotero collection

Admittedly, this file likely has a bit of sloppy code, as this was my first project and introduction to LaTeX. Because I like to keep things interesting (apparently), I decided that creating a research poster on a very short turnaround timeline while negotiating an out-of-state move during the middle of a Pandemic was the PERFECT time to crash course myself in LaTeX. 

Anyway, feel free to throw some feedback my way. This was fun but I'd like to improve on this skill moving forward.
